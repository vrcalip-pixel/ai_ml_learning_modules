                <h2>Welcome to the World of AI!</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence is all around us—from the recommendations you see on Netflix to voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. But what exactly is AI, and how does it work? In this module, you'll discover the fundamentals of AI in a way that's easy to understand, even if you've never studied computer science before.</p>
                
                <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>

                <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is the ability of machines and computer programs to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes things like learning from experience, understanding language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.
                </div>
                
                <p>Think of AI as teaching computers to "think" and learn, similar to how humans do—but in their own unique way.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    When you type a search query into Google, AI helps predict what you're looking for. When Netflix suggests a show you might like, that's AI analyzing your viewing habits. When your phone recognizes your face to unlock, that's AI at work!
                </div>
                
                <h3>AI vs. Human Intelligence</h3>
                <p>It's important to understand that AI doesn't "think" exactly like humans do. While humans use creativity, emotions, and life experiences to make decisions, AI uses data, patterns, and algorithms (step-by-step instructions).</p>

                <p>AI might seem like a modern invention, but people have been dreaming about intelligent machines for centuries! Let's take a journey through time to see how AI evolved.</p>

                        <h3>The Birth of AI</h3>
                        <p><strong>1950:</strong> Alan Turing, a British mathematician, asked "Can machines think?" and created the famous Turing Test to measure machine intelligence.</p>
                        <p><strong>1956:</strong> The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined at a conference at Dartmouth College. This is considered the official birth of AI as a field of study.</p>

                        <h3>Early Optimism & Challenges</h3>
                        <p>Scientists created early AI programs that could play checkers and solve algebra problems. However, computers were slow and expensive, limiting what AI could do. This period had lots of excitement but also disappointments when AI couldn't deliver on big promises.</p>

                        <h3>The AI Winter & Revival</h3>
                        <p>Funding for AI research decreased during the "AI Winter" when progress slowed. But the 1990s brought new hope with expert systems (programs that could give advice like human experts) and the first time a computer (Deep Blue) beat a world chess champion in 1997!</p>

                        <p>The internet provided massive amounts of data, and computers became much more powerful. Machine learning (where computers learn from data) became incredibly effective. AI started appearing in everyday products like smartphones and recommendation systems.</p>

                    <h4>🔑 Key Takeaway</h4>
                    <p>AI hasn't been a steady march forward—it's had ups and downs. The breakthroughs we see today are built on decades of research, failed experiments, and persistent scientists who kept believing in the potential of intelligent machines.</p>

            <div class="section" id="section3">
                <h2>Key Concepts in AI</h2>
                <p>Now that you know what AI is and where it came from, let's explore some fundamental concepts that make AI work. Don't worry—we'll keep it simple!</p>
                
                <h3>1. Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Machine Learning</strong> is a way of teaching computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every single task. Instead of giving step-by-step instructions, we show the computer examples, and it figures out patterns on its own.
                </div>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    Imagine teaching a child to recognize dogs. You don't give them a rulebook with "has four legs, has fur, barks." Instead, you show them pictures of different dogs, and they learn what makes a dog a dog. Machine learning works the same way—show it thousands of dog pictures, and it learns the pattern!
                </div>
                
                <h3>2. Neural Networks & Deep Learning</h3>
                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Neural Networks</strong> are AI systems inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of connected "neurons" (not real neurons, but mathematical functions) that process information. <strong>Deep Learning</strong> uses neural networks with many layers to learn very complex patterns.
                </div>
                
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <div class="concept-title">Why "Deep" Learning?</div>
                    <p>The "deep" refers to having many layers in the neural network. Each layer learns to recognize different features—early layers might detect edges and colors, while deeper layers recognize more complex features like faces or objects.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    When you upload a photo to Facebook and it automatically suggests tagging your friends, that's deep learning recognizing faces by analyzing millions of facial features through multiple layers of processing.
                </div>
                
                <h3>3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> is the branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language. It's what powers chatbots, translation apps, and voice assistants.
                </div>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    When you ask Siri "What's the weather today?" NLP helps it understand that you're asking about current weather conditions, not the weather yesterday or tomorrow. When Google Translate converts English to Spanish, that's NLP in action!
                </div>
                
                <h3>4. Computer Vision</h3>
                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Computer Vision</strong> gives computers the ability to "see" and understand images and videos, similar to how humans use their eyes and brain to interpret visual information.
                </div>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    Self-driving cars use computer vision to detect pedestrians, read traffic signs, and identify lane markings. Medical AI can analyze X-rays and MRI scans to help doctors spot potential health issues.
                </div>
                
                <h3>5. Training Data & Algorithms</h3>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <div class="concept-title">Training Data</div>
                    <p>This is the information we feed to AI systems so they can learn. The more quality data an AI has, the better it can learn patterns and make predictions. Think of it like studying material before a test—the more relevant examples you study, the better prepared you are!</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <div class="concept-title">Algorithms</div>
                    <p>An algorithm is simply a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem or complete a task. AI algorithms are special because they can adjust themselves based on the data they see, getting better over time.</p>

                        <li><strong>Bias:</strong> AI can reflect biases present in training data, which can lead to unfair outcomes</li>
                        <li><strong>Jobs:</strong> AI is changing the job market, automating some tasks while creating new opportunities</li>
                        <li><strong>Ethics:</strong> We need to think carefully about how AI should be used in society</li>
